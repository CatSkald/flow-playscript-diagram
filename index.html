TITLE: Tutorial Diagram
BY: CatSkald
SYNOPSIS: |
  Here you can write a brief description of the diagram or the illustrated process.
  An act represents the whole process which can consist of one or more flows. A scene is a single flow, i.e. a set of services and their relationships.
  To draw a diagram it is enough to describe a single act with a single scene. Currently only "one-acters" (single act plays) are supported.
CHARACTERS:
  - Audit Service: Characters are the services, users and systems involved in the diagram. [Database]
  - Reporting Service: Character description can be seen in the legend.
  - Mail Service: You can also add tags in the end of description (enclosed in square brackets) like so [3rd party]
  - Accountant: Tags affect the appearance of the character. For example "Out of scope" sets the color and "User" changes the shape. You can add other tags which will be mentioned in the legend. [User, Out of scope]
  - Bug: It might be useful to add custom tags and unused characters - those still appear in the legend. [Bug, Out of scope]
PLOT:
  - ACT 1:
      - SCENE 1:
          - Each scene can consist of dialogues (communication between the characters) and stage directions ("narrative text", description of triggers, actions, side effects).
          - REPORTING SERVICE:
              - (To MAIL SERVICE) Hello, World!
          - MAIL SERVICE:
              - (To REPORTING SERVICE) Yes, I hear you.
      - SCENE 2:
          - Character names inside a plot are always UPPERCASE.
          - A line starting with "(To ...)" indicates an addressee of the message. It is possible to mention multiple addressees separated with commas. Characters can speak to themselves too.
          - ACCOUNTANT:
              - (To REPORTING SERVICE) Generate my report.
              - (To ACCOUNTANT) Writes herself a sticky to check his email later.
          - REPORTING SERVICE:
              - (To AUDIT SERVICE) User triggered the report generation.
              - (To MAIL SERVICE [async], AUDIT SERVICE) Report is generated and sent to two services.
              - (Square brackets contain a tag for a type of communication. "async" communication is drawn using a dashed line.)
              - (The previous line is another stage direction. It appears in the middle of the dialogue so must be enclosed in brackets (to distinguish it from speech).)
          - MAIL SERVICE:
              - (Sends email to the accountant.)
          - ACCOUNTANT:
              - (Drinks coffee and reads her report. Every play should end with a CURTAIN similar to the line below.)
      - CURTAIN
