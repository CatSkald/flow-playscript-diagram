This small project allows you to automatically generate flow diagrams based on textual representation in a form of a playscript.

A helpful tool for anyone who is more into literature than visual arts, or who prefers typing over drawing.

## Examples

Sample playscripts can be found in the `./examples` folder. Just copy the content into the [editor](https://refined-github-html-preview.kidonng.workers.dev/CatSkald/playscript-flow-diagrams/raw/master/index.html) and see it in action.

## Used Libraries

- [js-yaml](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml) to parse YAML
- [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) to draw diagrams
- [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) browser code editor for the demo
